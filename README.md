## Introduction

This repository houses various Shell Scripts programming practice problems and assignments that I've tackled as part of my coursework at NUCES Pakistan. The exercises cover fundamental concepts, algorithms, and more.

I've structured the repository to make it easy to navigate and locate specific assignments or practice sets.

## Folder Structure
- **`Notes/`**: Study Material - Focused on Shell basics, including $ commands, if-elif-else, loops, case, functions, strings, and more.
- **`Projects/`**: Innovation Hub - Fun projects implemented in Shell, each in its separate folder.
- **`Scripts/`**: Stash - Practice problems and exercises from Operating Systems lab sessions.

## How to Use
Use your preferred shell terminal (Windows or Linux).
